 * Samples showing use of the Console web application.
 * The following simple samples are provided:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ConsoleWaterDetector.java - a simple application topology demonstrating features of the console like viewing the topology by
 * Stream tags, Oplet kind and Tuple count.  A DevelopmentProvider is used which automatically adds a Metrics counter to the topology.
 * </li>
 * <li>HttpServerSample.java - a <i>very</i> simple application that just brings up the Edgent console - with no jobs.</li>
 * </ul>
