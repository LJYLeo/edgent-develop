# The "Quickstart" samples connect to the IBM Watson IoT Platform
# using the Quickstart feature that does not require device registration.
# When the samples are run they print out a URL which allows a browser
# to see the data being sent from this sample.
#
# IotpQuickstart2 demonstrates using the WIoTP API to initialize the IotpDevice
# connector as well as the ability to publish events using the WIoTP HTTP protocol.

# IotpSensors connects to your IBM Watson IoT Platform service
# as the device defined in your device config file.
#
# A prototype config file for your WIoTP registered device information 
# is provided in device.cfg.

# IotpDeviceSample and IotpGatewaySample
# connect to your IBM Watson IoT Platform service.
# They publish device events and print out received device commands.
# Use IotpAppClient to print out the generated device events and
# to generate the device commands.

# Prototype config files for your WIoTP registered device, gateway,
# and application client information are provided in
# iotp-device-sample.cfg, iotp-gwdevice-sample.cfg and iotp-app-client.cfg
