Sample Kafka Publisher and Subscriber topology applications.

By default the samples require the following kafka broker configuration:
- bootstrap.servers="localhost:9092"
- zookeeper.connect="localhost:2181"
- kafka topic "kafkaSampleTopic" exists
- no authentication

See README-kafka for information about setting up a kafka server
and creating the topic.

The source code for the samples is in the <edgent-release>/samples directory.

Running the simple sample
-------------------------

Modify the kafka.properties file if required.

# run the simple sample subscriber
# the subscriber runs forever printing out each received message
$ ./runkafkasample.sh sub

# run the simple sample publisher
# the publisher runs forever printing out each published message
$ ./runkafkasample.sh pub

Running the fully configurable clients
--------------------------------------

# To see how to specify different values:
$ ./runkafkaclient.sh -h

# run the sample subscriber
# the subscriber runs forever printing out each received message
$ ./runkafkaclient.sh sub

# run the sample producer
# the producer runs forever printing out each published message
$ ./runkafkaclient.sh pub
