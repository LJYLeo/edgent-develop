Sample JDBC connector dbms writer and reader topology applications.

The following configuration is assumed:
- Apache Derby is installed and the environment variable DERBY_HOME is set

The writer is a simple JDBC connector sample demonstrating
streaming write access of a dbms to add stream tuples to a table.

The reader is a simple JDBC connector sample demonstrating
streaming read access of a dbms table and creating stream
tuples from the results.

The source code for the samples is in the <edgent-release>/samples directory.

Running the simple sample
-------------------------

Modify the jdbc.properties file if required.

# run the simple sample writer
# the writer runs briefly and prints out additions to the table
$ ./runjdbcsample.sh writer
Inserting into persons table: person id=1 first=John last=Doe
Inserting into persons table: person id=2 first=Jane last=Doe
Inserting into persons table: person id=3 first=Billy last=McDoe
$

# run the simple sample reader
# the reader runs briefly and prints out retrieved info
$ ./runjdbcsample.sh reader
retrieved person: id=1 first=John last=Doe
retrieved person: id=2 first=Jane last=Doe
retrieved person: id=3 first=Billy last=McDoe
Unknown person id=99999
